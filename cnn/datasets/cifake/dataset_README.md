## Dataset details

The dataset contains two classes - REAL and FAKE. For REAL, the images were collected from Krizhevsky & Hinton's CIFAR-10 dataset. For the FAKE images it was generated the equivalent of CIFAR-10 with Stable Diffusion version 1.4. There are 100,000 images for training (50k per class) and 20,000 for testing (10k per class).
